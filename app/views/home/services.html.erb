                        <p>Drafting with us includes consultations that involve multiple procedures. You will 
                        first meet with the engineer who will be drafting your fixture and finding out exactly 
                        what you want to be built. Once this process is complete, the engineer will be sent to 
                        the location to take accurate measurements. Once measurements have been recorded the 
                        drafting begins and an estimate will be applied. Once the drafting is complete we will 
                        send a Quote for the Designing and Manufacturing process to allow you to determine if you 
                        would like to proceed with our services.</p>
